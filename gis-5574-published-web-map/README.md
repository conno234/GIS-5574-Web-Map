# GIS 5574 Published Web Map

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/conno234/pen/JjxrOvE](https://codepen.io/conno234/pen/JjxrOvE).

This is a topographic map of the world, courtesy of a web map from ArcGIS Online. The default code has been modified in a few ways. Chief among them, the web map link in the Javascript window now links to the shown topographic map. In addition, code has been added that sets the default zoom and center of the map, causing the map to rest over the midwestern United States. Finally, I adjusted the position of the click button in the CSS window so that the button isnâ€™t as close to the edges.
